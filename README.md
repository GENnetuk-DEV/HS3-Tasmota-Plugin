Tasmota Plugin for HS3 Developed by GEN Special Projects (https://www.gen.uk)

Development was discontinued in 2022, and the codebase was released open-source. https://www.gen.uk/index.php?page=Homeseer

Its important to note that this plugin uses the DeviceString to match up MQTT devices to HS3 devices. 
The code may still have links to old support pages that no longer exist. 

Release to the community, do with as you please but absolutely not for financial gain.
